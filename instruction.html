    Try to beat the quiz by answering all the questions. It's that simple as that! Or is it ...? The questions are far from easy. Some require insane logic, others are completely down to guessing. It's hard but it's NOT Impossible! You have 3 lives throughout
    the quiz. Get an answer incorrect and you'll lose one. Lose all 3 lives and it's Game Over.
